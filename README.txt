To perform download and installation of PC App Store please run appstore_install.au3.

The rest of included files are UDFs for Web Driver (WD) and MSEdge webdriver itself.
They are used just to allow usage of the WD in oreder to download the installer from https://pcapp.store

The script is pretty raw but working. Although it misses logging and assertions which should
be added instead of 'If error...' statements. And uninstallation has to be added as well,
but this is out of scope of the task, and since it's not blocking script execution I skipped it.
